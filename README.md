# Churn Prediction
Welcome to the Churn Prediction repository. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn, a critical business metric that impacts customer retention and revenue.

# Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict customer churn in a ecom dataset. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to when a customer stops their subscription or relationship with a company. Identifying customers at risk of churning gives businesses an opportunity to develop strategies for retaining them, enhancing customer satisfaction, and improving overall profitability.
